# ros2_usb_serial
A simple ROS 2 package for microcontroller communication over USB seria

This package provides two essential scripts for working with microcontroller data over USB serial in ROS 2:

    Data Reader: Reads sensor data sent via serial from your microcontroller and publishes it as ROS 2 messages, enabling real-time monitoring and processing.

    Data Logger: Subscribes to the published sensor data and saves it into a text file, making it easy to collect datasets for analysis and evaluation.
